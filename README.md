# run analysis.R

## How to use

1. Download the source data - details can be found in the code book (codebook.md)
2. set your working directory to the directory containing the source data root directory

	e.g. if the data is stored in C:/Coursera/DataScience/GettingAndCleaningData/UCI HAR Dataset
	then your working directory would need to be: C:/Coursera/DataScience/GettingAndCleaningData
3. Download run_analysis.R and save in your working directory
4. run ```source("run_analysis.R")``` in R Studio

The resultant file ```AggregatedData.txt``` will be stored in the working directory

N.B.
Relative file paths are used in the script for all import and export files and are defined in the beginning. 
These can be changed as required.
